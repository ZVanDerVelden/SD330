<h2><b><u>UI, UX, HCI</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>- User Interface-</b> is the process of building interfaces in softwares or computerized devices, typically
        focusing on looks and aesthetics.</li>
    <li><b>- User Experience-</b> typically focuses on having a better understanding of users and what they need/want in a
        website or software. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Being able to really understand the user can be done by using techniques such as <b>brainstorming, personas,
                story boards, and user flows</b></li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>- UX Writing-</b> the practice of choosing the words people see when
        they interact with software, an app, or a website.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Mock ups</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- Mock ups are a model or replica of a machine or structure, used for instructional or experimental purposes. They
        look a bit like screenshots from a complete app, but are more than just images.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Constraints</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>- Theory of Constraints-</b> A methodology for identifying the most
        limiting factor to achieve a milestone and then systematically
        improving the constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Accessibility</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- Having an accessible design system involves having a product be fully available for those who may have some
        issues that usually hold them back from using such products.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>SDLC</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- SDLC is a conceptual model that includes rules and procedures for developing or altering systems throughout
        their life cycles</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Agile</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- The agile model is a flexible and adaptive approach to designing systems that can respond to changing
        requirements and customer needs.</li>
    <li><b>- Agile UX</b> is
        a working method that brings together Agile software
        development and UX practice
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>DevOps</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>- Continuous Integration-</b> Every day developers are committing codes
        in a shared repository which is a good development practice.</li>
    <li><b>- Continuous Delivery-</b> Any software should be in a releasable state
        throughout its lifecycle</li>
    <li><b>- Continuous Deployment-</b> Every change in each of its development
        phase should pass all automated tests at the time of production</li>
    <li><b>- Value Stream Mapping-</b> A lean tool that helps in depicting the entire
        flow of information, material, and works across functional silos
        including quality and time</li>
    <li><b>- Theory of Constraints-</b> A methodology for identifying the most
        limiting factor to achieve a milestone and then systematically
        improving the constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Teslers Law of Complexity</b></u></h2>
<li><b>Lawrence Tesler</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>- HCI expert at Xerox, Apple, Amazon, and Yahoo.</li>
    <li>- helped developed early graphical interfaces, and co-created
        copy-and-paste
        functionality</li>
    <li>- Complexity is necessary when we have apps that have a lot of functionality</li>
    <li>- Apps do not need to be incredibly simple</li>
    <li><b>- For any system there is a certain amount
            of complexity which cannot be reduced!</b></li>
</ul>

<h2><b><u>Four Activities of ID</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b><u>Requirements</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Many projects start by discovering requirements from which alternative designs are generated. Prototype
            versions of the designs are developed and then evaluated.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b><u>Alternatives</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- During prototyping or based on feedback from evaluations, the team may need to refine the requirements
            or to redesign. One or more alternative designs may follow this iterative cycle in parallel. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b><u>Prototyping</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- The next step is when you begin to form prototypes. Here you will keep on working to improve it and will go
            between evaluating those prototypes or designing alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b><u>Evaluating</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Many times through the cycle the product goes, development ends with an evaluation activity
            that ensures that the final product meets the prescribed user experience and usability criteria.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Models and Metaphors</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Conceptual Models</b></li>

    <ul>
        <li>- A mental model is the user's representation if our design the
            product may be hard to learn, hard to use or rejected</li>
    </ul>

    <li><b><u>Mental Models</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Mental models are nothing more and nothing less than the
            intuitions we have about how something works—how its pieces
            and functions fit together.</li>
        <li>- They’re based on the things we’ve used before; you might say:
            the entire task of user experience is the challenge of fitting a
            new product to our mental models of how things should work.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b><u>Metaphors</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Metaphors are set of user interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that
            users already have of other domains</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Jakob's Law</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that
        users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites
        they already know.
    </li>
    <li>- A good design principle: When making changes, minimize
        discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar
        version for a limited time.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b><u>The Legacy Problem</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- The reason behind inelegant designs is due to the fact that they have existed for too long and have become the
        standard</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Skeumorphic</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>- Skeuomorphic-</b>
        incorporating old, familiar ideas into new
        technologies. One way of overcoming the fear of the new</li>
</ul>

<h2><b><u>Triangulation</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>- Triangulation- Triangulation explains that research should be done with multiple different perspectives
            to fully
            gain all possible knowledge</b></li>
    <li> - Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in
        different places, or from different people (possibly by using a different sampling technique).
    </li>
    <li>- Investigator triangulation means that different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so
        on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data.</li>
    <li>- Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which
        to view the data or findings</li>
    <li>- Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id='column3' class='floatRight'>

<h2><b><u>User Stories</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- User stories communicate requirements between team members. Each one represents a unit of
        customer-visible functionality and serves as a starting point for a conversation to extend and
        clarify requirements. User stories may also be used to capture usability and user experience
        goals. Originally, user stories were normally written on physical cards that deliberately constrained the amount
        of information that could be captured in order to prompt conversations
        between stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Affordances vs Signifiers</b></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b><u>Affordances</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Affordances are clues that an action can be performed</li>
        <li>- A web button is a clue that it can be ‘pushed</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b><u>Signifiers</b></u></li>
    <ul>
        <li>- Signifiers guide and/or direct people to use that affordance</li>
        <li>- A web button’s label (ex: “SUBMIT”) is a signifier. If the button is
            highlighted or shaded, that is a signifier</li>
        <li><b>- In design, signifiers are more important than affordances</b></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Feedback</u></b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- Feedback is very important and provides users guidance when using your interface</li>
    <li>- It must be immediate and communicate the results of an action, good or bad</li>
</ul>

<h2><b><u>Perception</u></b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- The idea of perception communicates to us that it is easier to recognize something than to relearn it</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Attention</u></b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Attention is selective</li>
    <li>You must work to design a nice interface that will keep your users attention</li>
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Feedback</u></b></h2>
<ul>
    
    <li>- Feedback is very important and provides users guidance when using your interface</li>
    <li>- It must be immediate and communicate the results of an action, good or bad</li>
    
</ul>
<h2><b><u>Human Centered Design</u></b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>- Design is concerned with how things work, how they
        are controlled, and the nature of the interaction
        between people and technology.</li>
</ul>
